# Minecraft AI

Using reinforcement learning to design an intelligent AI for Minecraft. The model uses image analysis to "see" it's world and optimizes play in a closed system

# Installation

You must be running Windows to run this AI (We require keybindings,screen capturing, and mouse control through the win32api) 

Create a conda environment using

	conda create --name ENV_NAME python=3.4

Install from the list of requirements.

	pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to Run

To run the AI, do the following. We assume that you have already started your conda environment using

	source activate ENV_NAME

1) First, we must configure Minecraft to the correct settings. As of the moment, you must set the following options: 

- Resolution: 1366x768
- Block Distance: less than 10
- No Light Shading
- Windowed Mode


2) Start Minecraft
3) Run the following command
	
	python -i start.py

	>>> main()

A prompt will appear to switch to your minecraft window: do so, and watch the AI run

# TODO
- ~~Allow computer to control game inputs~~
- ~~Get display~~
- Machine learning algorithm for detecting block
